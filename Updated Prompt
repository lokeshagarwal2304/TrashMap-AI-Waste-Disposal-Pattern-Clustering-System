🌍 TrashMap AI is a next-gen, AI-powered waste management & smart mapping system for cleaner cities and smarter governance. It leverages real-time computer vision, geolocation intelligence, and voice-based reporting to identify, locate, and resolve garbage-related issues using community participation and municipal collaboration.

Users can simply click a picture, record a voice message, or type a report — the AI system then:

Detects waste category (plastic, organic, e-waste, etc.),

Maps the location,

Prioritizes severity using ML models,

Notifies nearby municipal workers or volunteers via dashboard alerts.

✨ Use Cases:
Smart Cities & Rural Cleanliness Drives

Real-time public hygiene reporting

Swachh Bharat integration

NGO-led community cleanups

School/college environmental projects

🧠 2. Severity Scoring Model
ML model scores priority (e.g., roadside hazard = high, residential corner = low)
