# ♻️ TrashMap AI

**TrashMap AI** is an innovative machine learning project that clusters urban waste hotspots using unsupervised learning techniques and geospatial data. This system is built to assist municipalities and smart city planners in optimizing waste collection routes, identifying garbage overflow zones, and improving public hygiene infrastructure.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📍 **Location-Based Clustering**: Automatically detects waste-heavy zones using KMeans or DBSCAN algorithms.
- 🧠 **Unsupervised Learning**: No labeled data required – patterns emerge directly from raw inputs.
- 🌐 **Geospatial Integration**: Uses bin location, GPS, fill-levels, and timestamps.
- 🔄 **Route Optimization Ready**: Can be extended to integrate route planning APIs for real-time scheduling.
- 📊 **Visual Analysis**: Cluster maps and heatmaps help visualize overflow-prone areas.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **Scikit-learn**
* **Pandas & NumPy**
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly**
* **Folium / Geopandas** (for map visualization)
* **Google Colab** (for development)

---

## 📉 Dataset Sources

You can use or combine datasets from:

* [Kaggle Waste Management Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
* [OpenStreetMap Bin Location API (Overpass Turbo)](https://overpass-turbo.eu/)
* [Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets) (custom integration possible)

---

## 📊 How It Works

1. **Load Data** → Bin locations, timestamps, fill levels
2. **Preprocess** → Clean nulls, normalize geolocation/fill values
3. **Cluster** → Use KMeans / DBSCAN to group bins into 'overflow zones'
4. **Visualize** → Plot on interactive maps with color-coded risk levels
5.**Route Plan** → Integrate with Google Maps API for optimized collection path

---

## ✅ Future Scope

* 🔔 Real-time alerts for overflowing bins
* 📲 Mobile app for on-field workers
* 🔁 API-based integration with smart city systems
* 🔍 Anomaly Detection for illegal dumping zones
