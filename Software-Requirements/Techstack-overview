**1. Python**

* Core programming language for data processing and machine learning.
* Enables integration of key libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.

#### **2. Google Colab**

* Cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment.
* Simplifies development, collaboration, and GPU-accelerated computation.

#### **3. scikit-learn**

* Machine learning library used for KMeans clustering.
* Allows us to segment locations based on trash density efficiently.

#### **4. Pandas & NumPy**

* Used for data handling and numerical operations.
* Supports preprocessing, feature scaling, and matrix operations.

#### **5. Matplotlib & Seaborn**

* Visualization libraries to create insightful 2D plots.
* Used for mapping clusters and evaluating spread.

#### **6. GeoPandas (Future Scope)**

* For enhanced spatial data handling and mapping trash clusters on real maps.
